Normalization confusion
How to store and work with complex numbers
How to store variables we need (normalization, alpha, beta, prob one and two).

How to return functions with objects, how to embind objects, how to embind their members. C++ std::complex not being recognized enscripten, so having to embind it as well or change how its represented.

I fixed these issues by first creating a structure called complexReplacement that contains two doubles to represent complex values. This allows me to pass a structure between js and c++ through emscripten, which is easy to do as long as you bind the struct using value_object and include the structures members. Then, I just convert between std complex and my complex struct replacement when I want to have std complex do the math heavy lifting (no need to rewrite it myself, its easy to convert between the two). Additionally, I also embinded my object, which now contains the complexReplacement struct instead of std::complex<double>, as a value_object. Because of this, it is not technically returned to js as a class where you can do stuff like new Class, but for what I need (just passing the changed values back and forth) its good enough (since I can do stuff like result.prob easily).
